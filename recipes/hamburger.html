    <h1>Hamburger</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a sandwich consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically
        beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often
        a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped
        with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>

    <p>Hamburgers are typically sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and other restaurants. There are many
        international and regional variations of hamburger. Some of the largest multinational fast-food chains have a
        burger as one of their core products: McDonald's Big Mac and Burger King's Whopper have become global icons of
        American culture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon crushed dried rosemary</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix, minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce,
            Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Use your hands to
            form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
        <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 to
            5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
            (74 degrees C).</li>
