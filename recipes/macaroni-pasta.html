    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Macaroni is dry pasta shaped like narrow tubes. Made with durum wheat, macaroni is commonly cut in short
        lengths; curved macaroni may be referred to as elbow macaroni. Some home machines can make macaroni shapes but,
        like most pasta, macaroni is usually made commercially by large-scale extrusion. The curved shape is created by
        different speeds of extrusion on opposite sides of the pasta tube as it comes out of the machine
    </p>
    <p>
        The word "macaroni" is often used synonymously with elbow-shaped macaroni, as it is the variety most often used
        in macaroni and cheese recipes. In Italy and other countries, the noun maccheroni can refer to straight,
        tubular, square-ended pasta corta ("short-length pasta") or to long pasta dishes, as in maccheroni alla chitarra
        and frittata di maccheroni, which are prepared with long pasta like spaghetti. In the United States, federal
        regulations define three different shapes of dried pasta, such as spaghetti, as a "macaroni product".

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Macaroni Pasta</strong>-Macaroni Pasta variety is preferred for this recipe however you can use any pasta variety for this dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables</strong>- I have used onion, tomato, capsicum and carrots. Additionally you can add mushrooms, cooked corn, baby corn or any other veggies of your choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and Herbs</strong>-Indian spice powders like red chilli powder, garam masala powders are used</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First of all, cook pasta perfectly. It shouldn't become mushy or cooked aldente as I recomment pasta to be cooked soft for most recipes to avoid digestion problems. </li>
        <li>Adding pasta cooked water helps in avoiding pasta from becoming dry. </li>
        <li>Add more colorful vegetables to make Macaroni Pasta more colorful and tasty. </li>
        <li>You need no additional garnish if the blended masala curry is tasty. I don't even add cheese for garnish and still the kids love it a lot.. </li>
        <li>You can even add a pinch of curry masala powder for extra flavour. If you have maggi masala powder you can add that too. </li>
        <li>This Macaroni Pasta should be moist and juicy and not dry so adjust the consistency accordingly. </li>
